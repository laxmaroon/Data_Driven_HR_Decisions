# 🧠 Capstone Project: Data-Driven Insights for Strategic HR Decision-Making

## 📌 Overview

This capstone project addresses a critical challenge in Human Resources: **employee attrition**. Using data science, I built a predictive system that helps HR teams anticipate and reduce employee turnover. The solution combines **exploratory analysis**, **machine learning**, and **ethical modeling** to deliver actionable insights for proactive decision-making.

## 🚦 Methodology: PACE Framework

### 🧭 Plan
- Framed the problem as a binary classification task.
- Defined project scope, goals, and evaluation criteria aligned with HR objectives.

### 🔎 Analyze
- Performed **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify key drivers of attrition.
- Used correlation matrices, boxplots, and segmentation analysis to uncover patterns.

### 🛠️ Construct
- Built and evaluated multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
- Addressed **class imbalance** using resampling techniques (e.g., SMOTE).
- Applied feature engineering and model tuning to improve performance.

### 📈 Execute
- Evaluated models using:
  - **Accuracy**
  - **Precision**
  - **Recall**
  - **F1-score**
- Prioritized **Recall** to ensure high sensitivity to potential attrition cases.
- Visualized feature importance and used SHAP/LIME for model interpretability.

## 📊 Data Visualizations

Visual storytelling was key in this project. Notable plots include:
- Attrition trends by department and job role
- Impact of overtime, job satisfaction, and tenure
- SHAP value plots to explain individual predictions

## 📉 Model Performance Highlights

| Metric     | Value (Example) |
|------------|-----------------|
| Accuracy   | 82%             |
| Precision  | 86%             |
| Recall     | 93%             |
| F1-score   | 90%             |

> 🚨 Note: Model metrics were interpreted with care, especially prioritizing **recall** to minimize false negatives in attrition prediction.
